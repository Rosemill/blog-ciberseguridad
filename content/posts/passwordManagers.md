Passwords Managers are a great tool to keep save your passwords and many other things. Most browsers have their own native password managers, which store all the passwords you use on the Internet to remind you when you go to log in to your different pages both on the computer and on other devices where you have them installed. However, these managers are quite basic and have practically no options beyond reminding you of your passwords.
Here it is a list of the best programs and apps you can use:

- Dashlane
- 1Password
- KeePass
- Enpass
- Keeper
- Bitwarden
- PasswordSafe
- Roboform
